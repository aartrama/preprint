#' Find promoter sites suitable for extracting a characteristic profile.
#'
#' @description
#' Finds promoter sites suitable to serve as training data for building a
#' characteristic profile for use with the pattern_likelihoods function.
#'
#' @details
#' Promoter sites are sites on the genome that have TSS annotations and are
#' also DNase binding sites.
#'
#' @param TSS_annotations
#'     A `GRanges` object containing the TSS annotations that will be used to
#'     mark candidate promoter sites.
#' @param DNase 
#'     A `GRanges` object containing DNase binding sites. There should be a
#'     `peak` metadata column here, At least three metadata columns should be
#'     present: `peak`, `qValue` and `signalValue`.
#' @param window
#'     The length of the window to cut around each promoter site. This window
#'     can later be used to create the corresponding coverage profile using
#'     `create_profiles`. The window will be centered on the promoter site.
#' @param N
#'     The number of promoter sites to find. Promoter sites with the highest
#'     qValue will be used (using signalValue to resolve ties).
#' @param between_promoter_distance
#'     Desired minimum distance between the selected promoter sites.
#' @param blacklist
#'     An optional `GRanges` object containing areas that should be avoided
#'     when searching for suitable promoter sites.
#' @param verbose
#'     A logical scalar indicating whether to print out informational messages
#'     during the search for suitable promoter sites.
#'
#' @return
#'     A `GRanges` object containing windows centered around suitable promoter
#'     sites. The promoter site itself lies in the center of the window. The
#'     `RGanges` object has a `type` metadata column that is set to
#'     `'promoter'`.
#'
#' @seealso [find_enhancers()] for finding suitable enhancer sites and
#'          [find_random()] for finding suitable random sites.
